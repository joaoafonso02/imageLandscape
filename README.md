# Intel Image Scene Classification of Landscapes

This project is an approach to the Intel Image Scene Classification of Landscapes, a multi-class classification issue with six classes: buildings, forests, glaciers, mountains, seas, and streets. The dataset, obtained via Kaggle, has a wide collection of photos representing various classifications. The primary goal is to create a strong **ResNet50** model that can accurately classify photos into their respective categories. In addition to the ResNet50 model, this study evaluates the performance of various machine learning models on this dataset, including **Random Forest (RF)** and **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**, to determine the best model for this classification job. Furthermore, the study compares the collected results to cutting edge approaches and related studies to provide a complete eval- uation of the proposed strategy. This approach demonstrates the efficacy of deep learning approaches, specifically ResNet50, for picture classification challenges while also laying the groundwork for future computer vision research and development.
